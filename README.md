# Find the Dog

A small Flutter game used for a Rive workshop, showcasing how to integrate Rive runtime into Flutter apps. This project will have a completed example, as well as a complimentary bare-bones example for folks to implement along in a Rive workshop, or on their own.

See `bare-example/` for the skeleton project code to implement in.
See `complete-example/` for the full source code.

More on getting started with Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

To run in the browser, navigate to the flutter project in either folder and run the following command in the terminal/shell:

```
flutter run -d chrome
```

The Rive file has been included in each of the projects for this game, so you don't have to pull it in.
